Boost Your Presentation
============

Yesterday your boss asked you to present
your new idea
to a group of important people.

You believe in that new idea,
you know exactly what you want to say
but you do not know HOW to say it.

Welcome to "Boost Your Presentation"!
An interactive talk that will give you seven new ideas
on how to make your presentation exciting, fun and easy to remember.

# Intro

Think about last year. 2017.
What comes into your mind?
Think about one, only one event that comes into your head at first.

Write the title of this event
in one or two words onto the paper in front of you.

For example "Birth of my second son" or "Christmas tree caught fire".
The throw it into my box and I'll read one or two randomly!

...

# Gathering

Reading:
* "My 30th birthday"
* "New cat"
* "Farewell party for Daniel"

For me, it might be the farewell party at SonarSource,
at the end of the year.
Or my colleague Seb making fun with the chicken hat during meetings.

Some events we can remember for a LONG time.
A year, a decade, a lifetime.

Others fade quickly. Within hours, minutes seconds.

How can we make our presentation easy to remember?

God gave us seven input / output devices:
Let's use them all!

## One Eye

Let's imagine you want to impress someone,
who only has one eye.

How could we make our presentation an extraordinary experience for her?

You could write down a joke.
You could show her a video.
You could send her an email.

And some presentations seem to be made exactly for HER.

## Second Eye

Now let's consider an audience with two eyes.
