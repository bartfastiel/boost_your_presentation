Boost Your Presentation
============

Yesterday your boss asked you to present

Others fade quickly. Within hours, minutes seconds.

Why do I always forget to take out the trash,
if my wife tells me to do it?
When I get to know someone, why do I forget his name instantly?
And why will I never forget the day, when I got to know my wife?

Strong memories are built, by

* repetition
* having impact on your future.
